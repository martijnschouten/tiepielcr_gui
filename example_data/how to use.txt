The files can be opened using:
import scipy.io as sio
A = sio.loadmat(file)

The mat files contain several variables:
-timestamps: this are the unix timestamps belonging to the impedance measurements
-time: this is the time that elapsed in seconds since the measurement started, belonging to the impedance measurements
-impedance data: This is the an array of complex values giving the complex impedance at each channel at frequency
-ref_offset: This is the low frequency part of the reference (=current) signal
-sig_offset: THis is the low frequency part of the voltage signal
-offset_tim: This is the time that elapsed in seconds since the measurement started, belonging to the ref_offset and sig_offset measurement
-settings: contains all the setting used during the experiment.
